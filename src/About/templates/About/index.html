            <p class="lead">The website is really intuitive and easy to use. It helps me get the information that I needed easily. I did manage to find
            a suitable child care centre for my kids and now I donâ€™t have to worry about them when me and my wife are out at work! How
            convenient and easy! I recommend parents, especially new parents to try out this app!!</p>

            <p class="lead">The website is ok. It helps me get the information I wanted about the childcares in Singapore. Although some additional new
            features can be added to make it a better and smoother experience for users. But I understand that this is just a prototype
            start-up and it has managed to reach my level of expectation for a new app.</p>

            <p class="lead">Pretty decent features for starters. Allow me to get the info that I need. Recommended. I understand this is the start of
            a new channel for parents to look for child care centres. But for future progression or new ideas, it can be extended to
            a finder for primary schools, secondary schools, JCs or even universities!!! I have hopes for this paltform to grow!</p>
